	<div class ="text1"><p>Once upon a time… aww never mind I spare you most of the boring details and jump to the college years.  Where I earned a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Administrations with a concentration in Finance from Western Carolina University in December 2005.  This is the degree that sound the best after taking on of those “great career quizzes”.  I completed my college education in three and half years while working a part-time job two hours away for campus.  I started my most desired career in the Finance industry at as a loan officer and was moving up the ranks until the bank industry and the economy took a beating.  Not to mention the beating I took when the real world hit square between the eyes.  After being let go from the bank I discovered that the counseling department at college doesn’t advice you on the economic outlook of the degree that fits your personality the day you take your career quiz.  With the Finance and Banking industry in all but ruins, I started a career in management and made it to Project Manager before falling victim to bad financial times in the company and another period of unemployment.  This time I have a wife and five month old son to consider when finding the next career path.  With the responsibility to provide for my family and after being let go twice from past jobs and want to find a position that offers stability.  A good friend of mine was starting a career as a Software Engineer and talked to me about it and started teaching me how to code.  This really sparked an interest in me.  I have always been more on the tech savvy side than most.  I am the one that gets a call, anytime a family member buys a new electronic device, to perform the setup.  After realizing that I really enjoyed programming I started to do some research on the job outlook and found that it is one of the most in demand careers.  So I thought I really can do something I enjoy and have a very stable career.  At this, I started looking into programming classes and found a Master’s program online but as a preregistration requirement I had to take Java programming at the community college, where I got hooked.  Instead of signing up right away for the Master I decide just to learn a few different languages.  I have taken classes on Java, C#, and Ruby on Rails and have picked a basic knowledge of some others along the way.  So that brings me the current stage of my life.  I looking for that first opportunity to prove my skills and pay my dues to tap into the best career in the world. <p></div>
